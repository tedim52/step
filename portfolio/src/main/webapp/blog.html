        <p> In an economy like this, where everyone knows the lagging indicators will be horrible,
          it's good to peek at some anecdotal data. Open Table reports its bookings for seated diners
          on May 26 were down 40% compared with the same day  last year, and that's great news, because
          they were down 100% during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The data gives investors a glimpse
          at how things may go as the economy continues to reopen, writes CNBC's Tom Franck. If diners are
          quick to return to their favorite eateries, the economy may be on a better trajectory than we think.

        <p> Google LLC’s (formerly Google, Inc.) mission statement and vision statement reflect the powerful
          position of the company in the global market. Founded in 1998, the company follows its corporate mission
          and corporate vision, leading to its current position as one of the most valuable brands in the world.
          Even after its reorganization leading to the company’s being a subsidiary of Alphabet, Inc., such
          brand value remains a major strength, as shown in the SWOT Analysis of Google LLC. The company’s
          mission statement defines the strategies of the business, such as the development of new products.
          In a similar way, the company’s vision statement pushes the organization to achieve new heights, such
          as through rapid innovation. The success of Google is directly connected to business efforts to fulfill
          its corporate mission and corporate vision. Such fulfillment supports the company’s growth in the computer
          technology (software and hardware), cloud computing, consumer electronics, and digital content distribution
          industries.
